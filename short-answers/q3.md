# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). In JavaScript, polymorphism can be achieved through prototype inheritance and method overriding.
```js
// Define a superclass
class Animal {
  speak() {
    return "The animal makes a sound";
  }
}

// Define a subclass Dog that extends Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    return "The dog barks";
  }
}

// Define another subclass Cat that extends Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    return "The cat meows";
  }
}

// Function to demonstrate polymorphism
function makeAnimalSpeak(animal) {
  console.log(animal.speak());
}

// Create instances of Dog and Cat
const myDog = new Dog();
const myCat = new Cat();

// Both Dog and Cat are treated as Animal
makeAnimalSpeak(myDog); // Outputs: The dog barks
makeAnimalSpeak(myCat); // Outputs: The cat meows

```
